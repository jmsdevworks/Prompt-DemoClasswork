# Prompt-DemoClasswork

This repository contains classwork and reference materials related to **Prompt Engineering** for large language models (LLMs), including examples of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies. These notebooks were originally provided as part of a learning module or educational program and are stored here for personal study and reference.

## 📁 Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Demo_01_Zero_Shot_Prompting.ipynb` | Demonstrates zero-shot prompting with LLMs, where the model is asked to perform tasks without any prior examples. |
| `Demo_02_Few_shot_prompting.ipynb` | Demonstrates few-shot prompting techniques, using a few examples in the prompt to guide the model's response. |

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Zero-shot learning
- Few-shot prompting
- LLM capabilities and limitations
- Prompt formatting best practices
